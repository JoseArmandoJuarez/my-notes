About this repo
===============
I am very grateful that there are organizations like Udacity that offer free beginner-like courses for people like me,
and this repo will showcase my notes about the courses I’ve been taking with Udacity but also from other organizations I’ll detail below.
(My aim is to help others with low budget make a career for themselves).
