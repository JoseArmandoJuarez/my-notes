## Why is VCS useful?
It enforces discipline because it manages the process by which the control of items passes from one person to another. Another important aspect is that it allows you for archiving versions and can also maintain a lot of interesting and important historical information about this versions. It also allows collaboration so people can more easily share data, files, documents through the use of VCS. Can also recover from accidental deletions or edits. Finally, allows you to conserve and save disk space on both the source control client and on the serve.

## How version control systems Work (BASIC)?
* You can add files to the repository which allows other people have access to it.
* A commit adds the latest changes to the source code to the repository, making these changes part of the head revision of the repository. 
* And finally you can update a file and others can too.

## TWO main types of VCS:	
* Centralized VCS -  a group of developers using the same repository
* Decentralized VCS - each developer has its own repository and later commits them to the main repository.
