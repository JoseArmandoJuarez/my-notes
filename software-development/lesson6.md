## Software Intensive System (SIS): 
Is any system where software influences to a large extend
the design, construction, deployment, and evolution if the system as a whole.

### EXAMPLE:
* SIS = software + hardware + context

* Person using an ATM = Software that drives the logic of the ATM machine + Hardware on which the software runs + In which the software is used (bank)

---

## Software Quality:
Software runs on some hardware and is developed for a purpose that is related to human activities.

Identifying the purpose of a software system means defining the requirements for the system.

---

## Software System:
Type of computer program that is designed to run a computer's hardware and application programs.

---

## Functional and non-functional Requirements:
	
### Functional: 
* Have to do with the functionality of the system what the system does with the computation. EX. an elevator that takes people to the floor they select.

### Non-Functional: 
* Is a requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the
operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors
* Security, accuracy, performance cost.

---

## User-Requirements: 
* Written for customers
* Often in natural languages, no technical details

---

## System Requirements:
* Written for developers 
* Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
* Clearly and more rigorously specified

---

## Elicitation - Collecting information
* One big problem is that is never written down
* Hard to describe knowledge that they regularly use
* Limited observability
* Information we collect might be bias and people might not want to tell you what you need to know

---

## Traditional Techniques for requirement elicitation :
* Background readings
* Hard data and samples
* Interviews
* Surveys
* Meetings

---

## Modeling Requirements:
1. Modeling enterprises
    * Goals and objectives
    * Organizational structure
    * Task and dependencies
    * Agents, roles, intentionality
2. Modeling Information
    * Information structured
    * Behavioral view
        * Scenarios and use cases
        * State machine model
        * Sequence diagrams
        * Information flow
    * Time sequencing requirements

---

## Analysing requirements:
1. Verification: developers will study the requirements to check whether they accurately reflect the customers needs as perceived by the developer.
2. Validation: Whether the requirements define the system that the stakeholders really want. 
3. Risk analysis: aims to identify the main risk involved with the development of the system been considered.

---

## Requirements prioritization:
* Limited resources
* Inability to satisfy all the requirements
* Need to prioritize them:
    * Mandatory
    * Nice to have
    * Superfluous (unneeded)

---

## Software requirements specification (SRS)
* Way to communicate requirements to others
* Different projects require different SRSâ€™s
