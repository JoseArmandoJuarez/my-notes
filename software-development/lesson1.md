## What is Software Engineering?
Computer software engineers apply the principles and techniques of computer science, 
engineering and mathematical analysis to the design, development, testing and evaluation 
of the software and the systems that enable computers to perform their many applications.

## Why do we need it?
Software engineering is important because specific software is needed 
in almost every industry, in every business, and for every function.

## Some of the most important reasons behind the Software Crisis:

1. The size and complexity of software was very limited and hardware component were really dominating the scene. Then things started to change and software started to be increasingly prevalent. 
So we move from a situation where everything was mostly Hardware to a situation in which software became more and more important.

2. Demand for software in NASA grew from 1980-1998.
3. Development effort needed due to the increase of product complexity.
    * The heroic effort of an individual developer can get the job done. That's what we call a programming effort. If you are a good programmer you can go sit down and do it right. Here are some examples: 
        * Class exercise
        * Small project
        * Term project
    * Now for the following this is called a software engineering effort. No matter how much programming languages, development environments, and software tools improve developers could not keep with increasing software size and complexity.
        * Word Processor
        * Operating system
        * Distributed System

## Mayor Causes of the Software Crisis:
* Increasing product
* Slow programmers productivity growth
* Rising demand for software
